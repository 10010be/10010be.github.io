title: Why I Switched from Ghost to Jekyll
---

I made a new blog using jekyll and Github Pages.

Before this I was content with [Ghost](https://ghost.org), a fun and easy to use blogging platform. I enjoyed the simplicity an even made a couple themes for it (check them out on my [Github](https://github.com/getmicah)), but what it lacked is that feeling of complete control over your blog. Also, I was getting tired of paying for my Digital Ocean hosting, even with the discount I got with the [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) discount. After hearing about the wonders of a "static" blog, I decided to do some hunting around for a new way to blog. Inevitably, I came across Github Pages and Jekyll. Free hosting and a static site blog? It was a no brainer.
