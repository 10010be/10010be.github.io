title: Arch Linux is Cool
---


For most my life with computers I have either used Windows 7 or Linux. Windows was great but once I finally decided to try Ubuntu I never went back. I tried out all sorts of Linux distros (ie. Elementary OS, Crunchbang, Linux Mint) but none of them seemed right for me. After doing some searching around and I came to the conclusion that I had to attempt the unthinkable, Arch Linux.

# 关于我的电脑
*Hardware*: The PC I mainly use is a desktop that I built a few years back with a Intel Core i5, Nvidia GTX 650ti, and 8 GB of RAM.

某君昆仲，今隐其名，皆余昔日在中学时良友；分隔多年，消息渐阙。日前偶闻其一大病；适归故乡，迂道往访，则仅晤一人，言病者其弟也。劳君远道来视，然已早愈，赴某地候补矣。因大笑，出示日记二册，谓可见当日病状，不妨献诸旧友。持归阅一过，知所患“迫害狂”之类。语颇错杂无伦次，又多荒唐之言；亦不着月日，惟墨色字体不一，知非一时所书。间亦有略具联络者，今撮录一篇，以供医家研究。记中语误，一字不易；惟人名虽皆村人，不为世间所知，无关大体，然亦悉易去。至于书名，则本人愈后所题，不复改也。七年四月二日识

*Usage*: On my computer I mainly write code using a basic text-editor (i.e. atom or sublime text) and browse the web. I sometime play video games on Steam, which include Civ5 and Besiege.


# The Dreaded Installation
Getting Arch Linux up and running on your computer really isn't that bad. Arch has great [documentation](https://www.archlinux.org/) and the [beginner's guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/beginners'_guide) makes everything very straight forward. It still took me a couple of tries to get a stable desktop environment (graphic drivers were tricky) but once I got all the basic stuff taken care of I was finally able to begin making the operating system I really wanted.


# So Why use Arch?
I'd be lying if I said I didn't use Arch because it makes me feel like a hacker elitist. Also seeing all the beautiful desktops on [/r/unixporn](https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn) also influenced my decision in using Arch. But, there are some legitimate reasons on why I prefer Arch over other Linux distros or any operating system for that matter:

* The best performance
* I choose what's installed
* Always the latest software
* Installing software is easy with pacman
* Very intelligent community
* Teaches you about how Linux works


# Conclusion
I really do see myself sticking with Arch for quite some time. With its rolling releases there will be no need to ever have to install any major updates and I have everything I really need in a computer. Though some things aren't perfect (ie. Steam isn't great yet) it's worth it for the gains in performance


# What's on my PC
Here's a short list of things I have installed on my main Arch Linux computer.

* Gnome 3 with [arc-theme](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme) and the [Paper icons](https://snwh.org/paper/icons/)
* bspwm (if I'm feeling extra hackerish)
* [mpv](https://mpv.io/) for all forms of media (ie. music and movies)
* Google's open source browser [chromium](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/chromium)
* [atom-editor](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/atom-editor-bin/) for coding (should probably learn vim better)

*Update:* I changed some of the "What's on my PC" entries due to the input on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/4c4mmh/blog_post_arch_linux_is_cool/). Thanks!
